# About_me_Anita
Hi, let me introduce myself:

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anita â€” a data enthusiast with a background in engineering and over six years of experience in the non-IT sector. My journey into data began with a curiosity for understanding customer behavior and solving real-world problems through insights.

ðŸŽ¯ After formally training in data analytics, Iâ€™ve developed hands-on skills in:

Python and key libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and modeling

SQL and Excel for data extraction and analysis

Tableau and Power BI for dashboarding and storytelling

ðŸ’¡ What sets me apart is my ability to merge technical skills with strong communication and problem-solving, honed from my years in customer-facing roles. I focus not just on dataâ€”but on the meaning behind the numbers and how they impact users and business decisions.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and looking forward to contributing to real-world projects, growing as a data professional, and collaborating with the data community here on GitHub.

Letâ€™s connect, learn, and build something impactful! ðŸŒ±ðŸ“Š
